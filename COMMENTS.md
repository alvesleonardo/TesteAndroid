# Leonardo Alves's Test



# Architecture
The clean architecture was chosen to provide better maintainability and testability.
Clean helps to avoid monolithic presenters, and improve the reuse of code, through interactors.



# Third-party libraries
  
- Dagger for dependency injection. 
  
- RXJava for data flows, composing asynchronous and event-based
  
- Retrofit, network
  
- Moshi, Fast and light JSON parser
  
- Stetho, for easier debug
  
- Butterknife, simplifies view usage
  
- Room, Architecture component for persistent storage



# What to improve
  
- Searchable listener, to be faster
  
- More tests, unfortunately, many tests were not implemented
  
- Better UI and more responses to touch
  
- Fixing theme
